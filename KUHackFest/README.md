###### This is a donations website
Some rules that Govern it's Working:
* Anybody can appeal for sanitary pads from anywhere in the world with thier name,address and occupation
* The appeal is registered on the BlockChain
* Donors can view the appealers and choose who they wish to Donate to.
* Any donor has to give 450 Rs, and 6 packets of sanitary pads will be delivered to the appealer. (there is no direct money transfer to avoid misuse of money)
#### Additional Rules
* Once the appealer recieves the packets for 6 months, she cannot appeal for next 6 months.This has been done so as to avoid further selling of pads.
* No-body can both appeal as well as donate to themselves.
