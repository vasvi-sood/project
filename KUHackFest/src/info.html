  <h1 class="why">Why the need?</h1>
  <div class="we-do">
    <p><strong><i>To help the women by providing them with the sanitary pads during the menstruation cycle.</i></strong></p>
    <p>A sanitary napkin, sanitary towel, sanitary pad, menstrual pad, or pad is an absorbent item worn by a woman while menstruating, recovering from vaginal surgery, for lochia (post-birth bleeding), after an abortion, or in any other situation where it is necessary to absorb a flow of blood from the vagina. Most of sanitary pads are disposable and are meant for single use only and some available with reusable sanitary pads, It comes in different shapes and sizes also.</p>

    <p>We are going to start our campaign and need donation support from all Public, Corporate, individuals, Government and Educational Institutions for needy women to provide them free Sanitary Pads with awareness about using PADS and prevention from infections. Lack of menstrual hygiene management is a major reason for majority of the girls skipping schools during their periods and eventually dropping out at an early age and missing out on their education.  Menstruation and menstrual hygiene related discussions are still not common in the Indian villages and across a large section of the urban society even now. Out of the 355 million reproductive age women and girls in India, only 12 percent use sanitary pads during their periods. The rest of them resort to old cloth pieces, husk, ash, dried leaves and grass or newspapers. Shocking! Isn’t it? More shocking is the fact that these unhygienic and unsanitary practices lead to a lot of infections such as fungal infections, urinary tract infection, cervical cancer etc. which can cause infertility and even death as per survey.</p>

    <p><i>· 87% girls using old clothes</i></p>

    <p><i>· 60% girls missed school on account of period</i>

      </p>

    <p><i>· 44% girls felt embarrassed and humiliated over restrictions</p></i>

    <p><i>· 6% girls have never heard of sanitary napkins</i></p>

    <p>Free sanitary napkins will be distributed to rural girls, new mothers and specially girls studying in government schools. As we all are aware that most poor or illiterate girls don’t know about PADS during her period days, So Under this campaign our volunteers will visit rural area/slum area/ Govt. School and villages for creating awareness among adolescent girls and women about the significance of using sanitary napkins.</p>
